An attempt to learn and read a graphical character set (in this instance,
subtitles on UK digital terrestrial broadcasts) using Python.

I've not touched this in ages, it might still work! Included is a sample
database built from the Tiresias font used by the BBC and others along
with some sample titles to learn from and test with.

YMMV
